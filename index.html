<p>piDisplay is a 16x2 character LCD based minecraft server notification system. You will need a Minecraft server running this plugin and build the hardware described in this guide. For ease of testing, the plugin is built against Bukkit v12.1 as this is what ran best on the RaspberryPi 1 that I used for this. I also used Glowstone instead of Spigot for this same reason. There is however, no reason why it wouldn't run higher versions on a more recent RaspberryPi. It's therefore slower but at least I know that this will run on any Pi. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Current prototype</b><br>This is just a video of some test code until I make something better.<iframe width="480" height="270" src="images/PrototypeVideo.mp4" width="512"></iframe></p>

<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#userguide" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How to use</h3>

<p>If you are not interested in playing with the code then just download the latest .jar file from the releases link.
After downloading, copy it to your minecraft server plugins folder. 
<br>The plugin displays messages on the display whenever someone joins or leaves the server as well placing any blocks.
<p> If you want to play with the source code then download the whole project from the links on the left. It was built in Eclipse using the Maven framework.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Schematic</b><br>The overall schematic, I used a 5V LCD which required level convertors for the 3.3V GPIO on the Pi. My life would have been easier if I'd just picked a 3.3V LCD in the first place. If you do this then you can just omit the level convertors.<a href="images/piDisplay.pdf"><img src="images/piDisplay.png" width="512"></a>
<br>Note that the resistor values were tuned to the actual LEDs/LCD that I had, YMMV. The original design that I did was based on using the full 8 bit interface so I could write entire bytes over the interface. This had to be shelved due to space constraints with the project box that I used but for the sake of completeness it's <a href="images/piDisplay8bit.pdf">here</a> </p>

<p align="center"><b>Level convertor</b><br>These are the FDC6301N based level convertors that I used. At the time writing something like <a href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/4-Channel-Bi-Directional-Logic-Level-Converter-3-3V-5V-Ardunio-ESP8266-etc/142603531109?hash=item2133d53365:g:MYwAAOSwyXNaHScq">this</a> should do the trick</a><a href="images/LevelConvertor.pdf"><img src="images/LevelConvertor.png" width="512"></a></p>

<p align="center"><b>Breadboard</b><br>This shows the prototype I used for testing.<a href="images/System.jpg"><img src="images/System.jpg" width="512"></a></p>

<p align="center"><b>Stripboard plan</b><br>This is by no means of indication of how this should be done. I'd normally mark up a much neater layout. I made numerous errors (you wouldn't think I spent nigh on 20 years in industry doing PCB layout) mistaking which way round the boards and header cables were which I could only get round by refactoring the schematic connections and gpio pinouts in the software. To that end, consider the layout and schematic an as-built design at best.<a href="images/PCB_Layout.jpg"><img src="images/PCB_Layout.jpg" width="512"></a></p>

<p align="center"><b>PCBs</b><br>These are the actual boards. For the reasons above these should just be considered as an as-built record. Please ignore the copious evidence of refactoring the layout and poor soldering.
<br>Front<a href="images/PCB_Front.jpg"><img src="images/PCB_Front.jpg" width="512"></a>
Back<a href="images/PCB_Back.jpg"><img src="images/PCB_Back.jpg" width="512"></a>
Top<a href="images/PCB_Side.jpg"><img src="images/PCB_Side.jpg" width="512"></a></p>

<p align="center"><b>Box</b><br>I used a standard black plastic project box for this. A lower voltage LCD would enable the central level convertor board to be removed and a custom PCB should enable a single board design. I just used stripboard as it's what I had lying around.<a href="images/BoxInside.jpg"><img src="images/BoxInside.jpg" width="512"></a><br>At the top right of the photo you can see the contrast adjust potentiometer. I built it upside-down deliberately so the screws and lid would be hidden and it would look more seamless in the living room.</p>

<p>This is me getting back into enjoying fiddling with electronics after 20 years of doing it for the day job and falling out of love with it. Now that the bills don't depend on it (note I've just changed career, I haven't "made it" or won the lottery"), I'm doing it for fun again. Any suggestions for improvements to the code are welcome, contact me on GitHub. It's been fun perhaps with the exception of my woeful attempts to understand Git merges!</p>
